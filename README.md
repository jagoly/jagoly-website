### Jagoly's StaticJinja website

Created for my Diploma of IT course.
To build the site on ubuntu 17.04, you will need to install some tools:

```
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 install staticjinja
sudo apt install ruby
sudo gem install sass
sudo apt install tidy
```

Then you can just do `./build.py`. The compiled site will then be available in the "./www" directory.
